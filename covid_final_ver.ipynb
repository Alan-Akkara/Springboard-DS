    "This story explores **the global spread, mortality, and recovery trends** using real-world data.  \n",
    "Through this analysis, we aim to answer key questions:\n",
    "- Which regions were most affected?\n",
    "- How did fatality rates differ across countries?\n",
    "- Where were cases growing fastest?\n",
    "- What can these patterns teach us about global preparedness?\n",
